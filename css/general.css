    ♫ Then you basically see that the entire design has shrunk by a factor of 62.5%. 
    ♫ And that's because 10 divided by 16 is 62.5%.
    ♫ And so maybe you can start to see why this will be really, really handy/useful when we build responsive layouts.
    ♫ We can simply change the font size up here in the html{} and that will then shrink everything down a little bit.
