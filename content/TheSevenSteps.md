# The 7 Steps to a Great Website

> - ♫ This section is all about building a real-world project.
> - ♫ Now, designing and building a website is not simply writing some code. It's a lot more than that.
> - ♫ So it's actually a whole development process that requires a lot of careful thinking and planning, and all that before you even write a single line of code.
> - ♫ So before we start building our project, let's actually learn the seven steps that are part of the development process.
> - ♫ So that you know exactly how to proceed once you want to start building your own websites.

## Steps

0. First of all, we need to have an idea and a purpose.
1. Then we need to define, in all its outlines, our purpose and idea that we want to finalize.
2. Then we need to make a plan.
3. Then we start thinking about the layout of the page and create some initial sketches.
4. And only then after these four phases we can finally start designing and building the website.
5. Then once that is done, we need to, of course, test and optimize that page before we can actually launch it.
6. Finally we can launch our project.
7. But even then, we are not done because any website that is live on the web needs to be maintained and updated, okay?
