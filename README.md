# Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS

> - ♫ Let me start by introducing you to **Omnifood**.
> - ♫ **Omnifood** is a fictional startup that I invented just for this course.
> - ♫ And what they do is to use AI to create and deliver custom healthy meal plans.
> - ♫ But right now, before they can actually launch their product they need a new, beautiful, modern, and clean website.
> - ♫ So, a website that will make them look like a professional and trustworthy company.
> - ♫ And so, that is where we come in. Because we will do exactly that.
> - ♫ So, together we will pretend that we were hired by **Omnifood** to design and build their marketing website using **HTML** and **CSS**.
> - ♫ So, this is gonna be a real world project where we're gonna use all the skills that we already learned and even a lot more.
