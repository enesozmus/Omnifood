# Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS

> - ♫ Let me start by introducing you to **Omnifood**.
> - ♫ **Omnifood** is a fictional startup that I invented just for this course.
> - ♫ And what they do is to use AI to create and deliver custom healthy meal plans.
> - ♫ But right now, before they can actually launch their product they need a new, beautiful, modern, and clean website.
> - ♫ So, a website that will make them look like a professional and trustworthy company.
> - ♫ And so, that is where we come in. Because we will do exactly that.
> - ♫ So, together we will pretend that we were hired by **Omnifood** to design and build their marketing website using **HTML** and **CSS**.
> - ♫ So, this is gonna be a real world project where we're gonna use all the skills that we already learned and even a lot more.

## Responsive Design Principles

> - ♫ Responsive web design is essentially a technique that we can use to make a webpage adjust its layout and its visual style to any possible screen size(window or viewport size).
> - ♫ So no matter if you're using desktop computers, tablets, or a mobile phone, a responsive website will be easily consumable on all of these devices.
> - ♫ It’s a set of practices, not a separate technology. It’s all just CSS!
> - ♫ There are essentially four big ingredients to responsive designs, and those are **fluid layouts**, **responsive units**, **flexible images**, and **media queries**.
