## Responsive Design Principles

> - ♫ Responsive web design is essentially a technique that we can use to make a webpage adjust its layout and its visual style to any possible screen size(window or viewport size).
> - ♫ So no matter if you're using desktop computers, tablets, or a mobile phone, a responsive website will be easily consumable on all of these devices.
> - ♫ It’s a set of practices, not a separate technology. It’s all just CSS!
> - ♫ There are essentially four big ingredients to responsive designs, and those are **fluid layouts**, **responsive units**, **flexible images**, and **media queries**.
